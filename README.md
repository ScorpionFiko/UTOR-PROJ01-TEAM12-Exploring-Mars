## Description

The web page provides an interactive experience for users interested in space and Mars exploration. The main sections, "Mission Control" and "Captain's Log", are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of space and Mars-related content. The Mission Control section is particularly noteworthy, as it offers two sub-sections: Space Exploration and Mars Exploration. The Space Exploration section allows users to delve deeper into the vast expanse of space by viewing images taken on a selected date range. This feature is perfect for anyone interested in learning more about the cosmos. The Mars Exploration section, on the other hand, provides a unique look at the Red Planet through the eyes of NASA's Mars Rover. Users can select a date and camera angle to view images captured on the rover's journey. This section is ideal for anyone who wants to see the Martian landscape from different angles. With this web page, users will have access to a wealth of information and resources about space and Mars.
